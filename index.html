    <h3> What did I do this summer? </h3>

    <h4> Perfect Game Baseball Tournament </h4>

    <p> I started my summer by playing in a baseball tournament with my team, Padres Scout Team.
    Because the firt day of the tournament was on a Friday, we did not have some of our palyers from California.
  Partially due to their absences, we lost our first game. The tournament had taken place in
  <a href="file:///Users/student/Desktop/Maps.html"> Hohokam Stadium</a>, the Oakland A's
  spring training fields.</p>

    <h3> What am I excited to learn?  </h3>

    <p> I am excited to learn many new skills in working with computers. Although I am very interested in
      this stuff, I have not done much work in this before.
